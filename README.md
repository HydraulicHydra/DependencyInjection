# DependencyInjection

I'm seeing no option in GitHub anywhere to download the sample code provided, but I understand the material well enough
to answer the given questions.  If you would like me to still upload the code, please instruct me how to do so, the GitHub
page provides no means that I can see and the 'how to download' page provides no helpful answers from what I can see.

1) Dependency Injection prevents multiple classes and/or similarly named objects from becoming confusing or conflicting
with each other within the code.  It helps with keeping code from becoming overwhelming or clunky.

2) Inversion on Control could be used to give a user the ability to determine what kind of logic they would apply to certain
situations- essentially, allowing changes between two separate areas of code that would no longer directly affect each other with.

3) The Explicit Dependencies Principle, in simplest terms, is a design principle that keeps classes from affecting parts of the 
code they don't explicitly mention, by intentioanlly making sure all needed parts for the class are contained within the
constructor object.
